# Analysis 1 - Mythologizing the French Revolution (Briana )

The French Revolution inaugurated the nineteenth-century, fundamentally shaping the distribution of powers in modern democratic states with the end of feudalism and positioning “the people” as the highest political authority [^1] [^2]. Emerging from the Revolution, conceptualizations of “progress” and the struggle against absolutism became the defining features of a rapidly industrializing Europe with various groups co-opting Revolutionary ideals and traditions for self-legitimation [^3]. The revolutionary tradition in nineteenth-century Europe was, then, an ambiguous heritage which political groups could appropriate and envision a proper society either past or present through mythmaking and production of popular culture which utilized imagery and language from the Revolution to claim inheritance of its ideals. 

Individualism and meritocracies were critical structures born from the Revolution, the latter being particularly effective in driving the nobility and aristocracy out with those remaining attempting to build a new regime through mythmaking, royalist populism, and the glamorization of life prior to the Revolution [^4] [^5] [^6]. Myth, in the context of the revolutionary tradition, does not refer to a false belief but rather a narrative that conveys a particular vision of society and historical representations formed by the groups propagating these accounts [^7]. For royalist aristocrats and clerical allies who operated through particularism and defense of traditional culture, mythmaking centered on idyllic visions of countries such as Germany who were still beholden to local nobles and medieval manors [^8]. Clergy members capitalized on religious persecution following the September massacres of 1792 and de-Christianization among certain bourgeoisie and government members to create martyr narratives, especially in rural France where religion was an integral factor in community life and routine [^9]. Mythmaking in royalist and religious circles centered on traditional and legal “orders” in pre-Revolutionary Europe that categorized society by states, arising from fear of the violence of the Revolution [^10]. Conservatism as an ideology was defined by this fear, dedicated to the restoration of the old regime through figures such as Edmund Burke who appealed to those searching for a sense of stability amidst a rapidly changing century. Russia was plagued by various economic problems which brought issues of change and conservatism to the forefront and questions of whether it would be possible to adopt a liberal democracy following the Revolution [^11].  Austria, Prussia, and Russia exploited fears of liberalism to legitimize their autocracies and conservative employers attempted to build family-oriented atmospheres to maintain loyalty [^12]. The “Metternich System” placed an inflexibility on conservative thought in idealizing pre-revolutionary structures, which was too strict and criticized upon inception, particularly by those on the left [^13]. 

Amidst the diminishing influence of the nobility, the French Revolution gave way to a new French middle class which dominated the collective consciousness of European society to the point of referring to the century as the “Age of the Bourgeoisie.” (Lecture; Winks, 8). The bourgeoisie were the main beneficiaries of the French Revolution which established private landownership but were particularly concerned over the lower-class and socialism which espoused public ownership of the means of production including land (Winks, 141). Utopian socialists were critical of individualism and favored cooperation over competition with Count Henri de Saint-Simon, the first utopian socialist, stating that those who maximized production should be rewarded more heavily than those who simply owned the most (Winks, 161). Studying the utopian socialists and histories of the French Revolution, Karl Marx connected class and organization of people based on industrial economy in his approach of historical materialism in which history is a product of class antagonisms (Marx 12, Winks 146). Representations of history were, then, a concern for much of Marx’s work such as The 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoleon which directly targeted mythmaking in groups conjuring “the spirits of the past to their service,” where the Revolution of 1848 parodied that of 1789 (Marx, 18th Brumaire, 5 PRIMARY). Marx was fascinated by the French Revolution however the revolutionary process was undoubtedly a bourgeois revolution which “abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.” (Marx, 34 PRIMARY). In ascribing bourgeois properties, Marx could discuss the necessity of a new, Communist revolution which would fulfill the imperfections of the French Revolution. 

The latter half of the nineteenth-century, especially after the relaxation of censorship laws in 1881, bore witness to an upheaval of the visual arts which capitalized on notions of popular sovereignty that emphasized the significance of “mass mobilizations,” particularly amongst the peasantry (Goldstein, 17; Winks). Anarchism was especially attractive to artists as many key thinkers, such as Petr Kropotkin, Russian prince and geologist, attached a critical significance to the role of artists in exposing the inequities of society to the lower-class (Leighten, 24). Anarchist theory stood for absolute individualism and abhorred organizational structures which positioned the movement on the fringes of political society. To combat this, anarchists drew from popular culture of the French Revolution which became a vehicle to push their revolutionary agenda to a wider audience (McKinley, 135). Anarchists were particularly enamored with the culture of the sans-culottes, desiring to become the anonymous revolutionary minority that would incentivize the masses to political action (McKinley, 34). Thus, the anarchists focused on graphic representations that were often symbolic of class warfare, depicting the working-class as miserable or formidable avengers and the bourgeoisie and associated allies as obese and cruel (McKinley, 120). For instance, in response to French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau’s violent suppression of the Draveil-Villeneuve-Saint-Georges strikes, Parisian magazine Les Hommes du Jour published an issue in January 1908 depicting Clemenceau with his head waving on a pike (Méric, 1 PRIMARY). Stating that Clemenceau wore the costume of Robespierre, anarcho-communist Victor Méric asserted that the legacy of the Revolution was a “frock,” drawing attention to the failures of the French Revolution in a manner that was accessible to the lower-classes through caricature. 

The French Revolution in nineteenth-century Europe was exploited by the various political groups that arose from the political turbulence, either drawing inspiration from or fearing the changes that developed in its aftermath. Conservative groups such as the royalists or clergy members idealized the pre-revolutionary social order and were defined by a strict rigidity that opposed political change. In contrast, left-leaning movements such as the socialists or Marxists were eager to envision a society free from oppression, often criticizing the Revolution as an imperfect experiment which enabled an exploitative bourgeois class to rule over the people. On either side of the spectrum, transmissions from the past allowed groups to appropriate aspects of the Revolution to validate political objectives and visualize a particular image of what society ought to be
